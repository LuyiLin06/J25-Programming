# Hardware and software
To represent how hardware and software work, the Von Neumann model is generally used:

## Types of computers
A computer is, in general terms, a device that is capable of computing data. Based on this definition, we can find a lot of different types of computers, such as:
- Laptops
- Computer towers
- Servers
- Mobile phones
- Smartwatches
- Calculator
- Consoles
- TV
- Home appliances (microwaves, fridges, etc)
- AC
- Wifi routers

## Inputs and outputs
Inputs are the messages sent to the computer to process. Some good examples of inputs could be:
- The keys on the keyboard when pressed
- The click of a mouse
- The sound receptor of a microphone
- The sensor in a webcam

Outputs, on the other hand, are the messages the computer sends based on the input received, such as audio, LEDs, lights on the screen.
## Components of a PC

### Power supply 

Like the name implies, it is responsible of providing the power needed for the computer to work. It cosists of multiple parts, such as:
- **An inductor**: Typically used as energy storage devices in switched-mode power devices to produce DC current
- **A diode**: Used to keep your power supply safe while you work with energy-storing devices such as batteries or large capacitors
- **A condenser**: Used to store a certain amount of power, and then release it rapidly
- **A heatsink**: It releases the hot air generated in the power supply to keep the systems cool
- **A microcontroller**: It is a compact integrated circuit that combines a processor, memory, and input/output peripherals, specifically designed to execute specific tasks within embedded systems

### Motherboard
It contains the main componentes of the PC, like the **CPU**

### BIOS
A BIOS (basic input/output system) is the program a computer's microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it is powered on.
