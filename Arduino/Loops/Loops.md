# Arduino Loops Notebook

## Introduction

Loops are fundamental constructs in programming that allow you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. In Arduino coding, loops are commonly used to perform tasks iteratively. There are two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops. In this notebook, we'll explore how to use these loops in Arduino programming.

## 1. For Loop

### Syntax:

```cpp
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be repeated
}
