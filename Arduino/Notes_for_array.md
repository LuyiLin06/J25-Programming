# Arrays
## 1. Declaration and Initialization:

Arrays in Arduino are declared by specifying the data type of the elements and the array name, followed by the size of the array in square brackets.


```cpp
int myArray[5];  // Declaration of an integer array with size 5
```

Arrays can also be initialized at the time of declaration:

```cpp
int myNumbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  // Initialization of an integer array
```

## 2. Accessing Elements:

Individual elements in an array are accessed using their index. Note that array indices start from 0.

```cpp
int value = myNumbers[2];  // Access the third element in the array (index 2)
```

## 3. Array Size:

The size of an array is fixed at the time of declaration and cannot be changed dynamically. It is important to stay within the bounds of the array to avoid memory-related issues.

## 4. Iterating Through Arrays:

Arrays are often used in loops for iteration. The `for` loop is commonly employed to iterate through each element in an array.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // Access and manipulate each element, e.g., myNumbers[i]
}
```

## 5. Multidimensional Arrays:

Arduino supports multidimensional arrays, allowing you to create tables or matrices of values.

```cpp
int matrix[3][3] = {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6},
  {7, 8, 9}
};
```

## 6. Strings as Arrays:

Strings in Arduino are essentially arrays of characters. They can be manipulated using array-related operations.

```cpp
char myString[] = "Arduino";  // Declaration and initialization of a string
char character = myString[2];  // Accessing individual characters
```

## 7. Working with Arrays in Functions:

Arrays can be passed to functions in Arduino. When an array is passed to a function, it is passed by reference, allowing the function to modify the original array.

```cpp
void modifyArray(int arr[]) {
  // Manipulate the elements of the array
}
```

Arrays in Arduino provide a powerful tool for handling sets of data efficiently. Understanding array manipulation is crucial for many Arduino projects involving sensors, displays, and other external devices.
